# EnemyOOPGame

A beginner-friendly Java game that demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming concepts. The game features a variety of enemies—Goblins, Ghosts, Ogres, and Dragons—each implemented as a separate class with unique behaviors using inheritance and polymorphism.

##  Features
- Java-based OOP structure
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Enemy interactions with basic game logic

##  How to Run
1. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (like IntelliJ or Eclipse).
2. Compile all `.java` files in the `src` folder.
3. Run `Main.java` to start the simulation.

##  Files
- `Enemy.java` – Base class
- `Goblin.java`, `Ghost.java`, `Ogre.java`, `Dragon.java` – Derived enemy types
- `EnemyGame.java`, `Main.java` – Game logic and entry point

**Note:** This project is for learning purposes and showcases class hierarchy, method overriding, and Java fundamentals.
